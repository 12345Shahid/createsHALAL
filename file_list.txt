To list all the files in your project excluding the files in .gitignore, use the following command in your terminal:

git ls-files

If You Want to Save the File List to a Text File

Run this command to create a file named all-files.txt containing the list of all tracked files:

git ls-files > all-files.txt

This will ignore files inside node_modules/ and any other patterns specified in your .gitignore file.


---

Alternative: Using find to List All Files (Including Untracked Ones)

If you also want to see untracked files (but still exclude ignored ones), use:

find . -type f -not -path "./node_modules/*" > all-files.txt

This method will list all files except those in node_modules/.


---

Now, open all-files.txt to view all your project's files. ðŸš€ Let me know if you need any more help! ðŸŽ¯

Based on the files we've created for Batch 4 and Batch 5, here are the files that contain placeholders or simulated functionality:

Batch 4:
No significant placeholders. These files mostly interact with Supabase directly.

Batch 5:
1. **/Users/shahidhasan/createsHALAL/api/generate_content.ts**
   - The `simulateAIGeneration` function is a placeholder for actual AI model integration.

2. **/Users/shahidhasan/createsHALAL/api/chat.ts**
   - The `simulateAIChatResponse` function is a placeholder for actual AI chat model integration.

3. **/Users/shahidhasan/createsHALAL/api/filtering.ts**
   - The `applyRule` function is a placeholder. You'll need to implement actual rule application logic based on your Halal compliance requirements.

4. **/Users/shahidhasan/createsHALAL/api/formatting.ts**
   - The formatting functions (`formatAsText`, `formatAsTable`, `formatAsPieChart`, `formatAsGraph`) are placeholders. You'll need to implement actual formatting logic for each type.

These placeholders are primarily in the AI interaction and content processing parts of your application. You'll need to replace these with actual implementations that integrate with your chosen AI models and apply your specific business logic for Halal compliance filtering and content formatting.
